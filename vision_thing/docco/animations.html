<p>
The first two rows above are the weight matrices of the respective neurons. White means a negative association with that pixel, black shows positive. Grey is neutral.
</p>
<p>
On the bottom left is the image being shown to the neurons. 
</p>
<p>
The top row of text is the name of the font being used. The first set of numbers shows the number correct and incorrect for this font. The second set show the total number correct and incorrect for the whole run.
</p>
<p>
If a weight matrix has a red border it means that neuron was mistaken and has had it's weights adjusted. If it's green it means the neuron was correct and no adjustment to the weight was made.
</p>
<p>
The animation will pause when it's converged on a font (a misalignment bug on Harabara aside - beta02).
