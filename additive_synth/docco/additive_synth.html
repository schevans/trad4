<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
This application is a concurrent additive synthesiser. The principal of additive synthesis is that any periodic waveform can be synthesised by adding together sine waves. There's a good introduction to additive synthesis <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Sound_Synthesis_Theory/Additive_Synthesis#Additive_Synthesis">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
This is a simplified model using no phase shifting and therefore only sinusoidal components. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesizer#ADSR_envelope">ADSR envelopes</a> are not implemented.
</p>
<p>
In this beta six presets are available: sine, pulse, sawtooth, square, triangle and Hammond.
</p>

<h2><a name="the_model">The Model</a></h2>
<p>
The model itself is made up of three or more tiers. On the first tier are the harmonics - the pure sine wave feedstock of our synthesiser. Next come one or more tiers of mixers, where the harmonics are added concurrently. On the last tier there is only an amplifier, which serves to normalise the output as appropriate.
</p>
<p>
The concurrency comes from the fact that each mixer subscribes to a sub-set of harmonics - in all the configurations presented here there are four harmonics per mixer - and the mixers in turn run concurrently. This model uses the Inheritance of Interface (IoI) feature of trad4 where a mixer can subscribe to a set number of harmonics <i>or</i> a set number of mixers, as both types isa sample.  
</p>
<p>
The number of samples per mixer is an optimisation parameter - the fewer samples per mixer you have the more concurrency you get but you also get more tiers. Optimisation of this application is beyond the scope of this document (though highly suitable for analysis as the app involves simple operations on large slabs of RAM which have to get dragged across buses). The concrete diagram below shows 2 samples per mixer for brevity. The application as configured in the distribution uses 4.

</p>
<p>
A new feature in trad4v3.1.2 is that the abstract and concrete graphs can now be generated for you, the first examples of which are below.
</p>
<h3>The abstract diagram</h3>
<p>
<img src="abstract.png" alt="abstract"/>
</p>
<p>
This application uses inheritance of interface (IoI), so it's abstract graph looks a little strange. Each type is considered separately and the tier axis on the left is relative. So that, from right to left, an amplifier of tier m subscribes to a sample of tier n, where m&gt;n. A harmonic can exist on any tier and subscribes to nothing. A mixer subscribes to an array of in this case 4 samples. A sample as our base type does nothing at all.

</p>
<h3>The concrete diagram</h3>
<p>
<img src="concrete.png" alt="concrete"/>
</p>
<p>
The concrete graph should look more familiar. This shows a graph where NUM_HARMONICS=8 and NUM_HARMONICS_PER_MIXER=2.

<h2><a name="the_waveforms">The Waveforms</a></h2>
<p>
The naming convention for the files below is as follows: name+frequency+num_harmonics. So "square_f1_h1024.wav" is a square wave with frequency 1Hz, synthesised using 1024 harmonics. Likewise "hammond_f261_h16.wav" is the Hammond preset with frequency 262Hz (middle C), synthesised using 16 harmonics. These files are best viewed using a sound editor such as <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a>. Be aware that only the Hammond wave is at an audible frequency.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<h3>The sine waveform</h3>
<p>
The sine wave is the simplest waveform, comprising simply of a single sine wave of the base frequency.
</p>
<a href="sine_f1_h16.wav">sine_f1_h16.wav</a>
<a href="sine_f1_h1024.wav">sine_f1_h1024.wav</a>
<blockquote><pre>
    if ( id == 1 )
        level = 1.0;
    else
	level = 0.0;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>

</p>
<h3>The pulse waveform</h3>
<p>
The pulse waveform comprises of an equal amount of each harmonic.
</p>
<a href="pulse_f1_h16.wav">pulse_f1_h16.wav</a>
<a href="pulse_f1_h1024.wav">pulse_f1_h1024.wav</a>
<blockquote><pre>
    level = 1.0;
</pre></blockquote>
<h3>The sawtooth waveform</h3>
<p>
The sawtooth waveform has a geometric drop-off of the amplitude of the component harmonics.

</p>
<a href="sawtooth_f1_h16.wav">sawtooth_f1_h16.wav</a>
<a href="sawtooth_f1_h1024.wav">sawtooth_f1_h1024.wav</a>
<blockquote><pre>
    level = 1.0 / id;
</pre></blockquote>
<h3>The square waveform</h3>
<p>
The square waveform has a geometric drop-off of the amplitude of the odd component harmonics.
</p>
<a href="square_f1_h16.wav">square_f1_h16.wav</a>
<a href="square_f1_h1024.wav">square_f1_h1024.wav</a>
<blockquote><pre>
    if ( id % 2 != 0 )		// Is odd id
	level = 1.0 / id;
    else			// Is even id
	level = 0.0;
</pre></blockquote>
<h3>The triangle waveform</h3>
<p>
The square waveform has an exponential drop-off of the amplitude, where every second active harmonic amplitude is negative.
</p>
<a href="triangle_f1_h16.wav">triangle_f1_h16.wav</a>
<a href="triangle_f1_h1024.wav">triangle_f1_h1024.wav</a>
<blockquote><pre>
    if ( id % 2 != 0 )		// Is odd id
	level = pow( -1.0, ( id - 1 ) / 2 ) * ( 1.0 / (id*id) );
    else			// Is even id
	level = 0.0;
</pre></blockquote>
<h3>The Hammond preset</h3>
<p>
This is a basic model of a Hammond tonewheel generator. More detailed information may be found <a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov03/articles/synthsecrets.htm">here</a>

<h3>Running</h3>
<p>
To run the application:<br/>
1) Download and unpack the distribution<br/>
2) cd into trad4_v3_1_2/additive_synth:<br/>
</p>

3) Source additive_synth.conf:<br/>
<blockquote><pre>additive_synth$ . ./additive_synth.conf</pre></blockquote>
4) Start additive_synth:<br/>
<blockquote><pre>additive_synth$ additive_synth</pre></blockquote>
<p>
To increase or decrease the number of threads used (the default is 4), set NUM_THREADS and re-start the application:
</p>

$ additive_synth</pre></blockquote>
<h3>Updating</h3>
<p>
To update a running system, log into the database:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>$ t4db
SQL></pre></blockquote>
<p>
And make any required updates. Then instruct the running application to collect these changes by using send_reload.sh:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>$ send_reload.sh</pre></blockquote>
