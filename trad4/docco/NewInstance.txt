To set up a new instance:
-------------------------

1) Decide on what the fundimental object types are going to be.
2) Create a t4 file for each one.
3) Create a object_type.t4s file.
4) generate_all.pl
5) If you use any enums in the .t4 files, define them in $INSTANCE_ROOT/objects/common.h
6) cd $TRAD4_ROOT && make
7) Hand-craft some data in $INSTANCE_ROOT/data. I find checking *Base::Save/Load helpful for this.
8) Start 'em up. Run the viewer. Send some reload signals to the feeds and satisfy yourself the objects are updating correctly. Shut 'em down when you're done.
