Change log
----------

The main change in this version is an overhaul of the app db layout for nested structures: Leaf array tables are no longer fully normalised. This means that what used to look like:
insert into my_table values ( id, 0, "H" );
insert into my_table values ( id, 1, "e" );
insert into my_table values ( id, 2, "l" );
insert into my_table values ( id, 3, "l" );
...
Becomes:
insert into my_table values ( id, "H", "e", "l", "l" "o" );
This breaks the t4v3.0 DB data layout but any upgrade will be a simplification.

Also:
Default settings in create_new_app.sh have been made more user friendly.

Fixed a few bugs and display issues.

Beefed up validation and reporting.
