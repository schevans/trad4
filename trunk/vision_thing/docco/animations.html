The first two rows above are the weight matrices of the respective neurons. White means a negative association with that pixel, black shows positive. Grey is neutral. A green frame means the neuron is CORRECT and no adjustment is made. A red frame means a FALSE_NEGATIVE - it has been shown the number it's looking for but if failed to spot it, so the weight_matrix is corrected upwards. A blue frame menas a FALSE_POSITIVE - it thought it had been shown the number it's looking for but it wasn't, so the weight_matix is ajusted downwards.

On the bottom left is the image being shown to the neurons.

The top row of text is the name of the font being used. The first set of numbers shows the number correct and incorrect for this font this time it's being shown. The second set show the total number correct and incorrect for the whole run.
