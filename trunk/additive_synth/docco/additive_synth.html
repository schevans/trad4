<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
This application is a concurrent additive synthesiser. The principal of additive synthesis is that any periodic waveform can be synthesised by adding together sine waves. There's a good introduction to additive synthesis <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Sound_Synthesis_Theory/Additive_Synthesis#Additive_Synthesis">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
This is a simplified model using no phase shifting and therefore only sinusoidal components. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesizer#ADSR_envelope">ADSR envelopes</a> are not implemented.
</p>
<p>
In this beta six presets are available: sine, pulse, sawtooth, square, triangle and Hammond.
</p>

<h2><a name="the_model">The Model</a></h2>
<p>
The model itself is made up of three or more tiers. On the first tier are the harmonics - the pure sine wave feedstock of our synthesiser. Next come one or more tiers of mixers, where the harmonics are added concurrently. On the last tier there is only an amplifier, which serves to normalise the output as appropriate.
</p>
<p>
The concurrency comes from the fact that each mixer subscribes to a sub-set of harmonics - in all the configurations presented here there are four harmonics per mixer - and the mixers in turn run concurrently. This model uses the Inheritance of Interface (IoI) feature of trad4 where a mixer can subscribe to a set number of harmonics <i>or</i> a set number of mixers, as both types isa sample.  
</p>
<p>
The number of samples per mixer is an optimisation parameter - the fewer samples per mixer you have the more concurrency you get but you also get more tiers. Optimisation of this application is beyond the scope of this document (though highly suitable for analysis as the app involves simple operations on large slabs of RAM which have to get dragged across buses). The concrete diagram below shows 2 samples per mixer for brevity. The application as configured in the distribution uses 4.

</p>
<p>
A new feature in trad4v3.1.2 is that the abstract and concrete graphs can now be generated for you, the first examples of which are below.
</p>
<h3>The abstract diagram</h3>
<p>
<img src="abstract.png" alt="abstract"/>
</p>
<p>
This application uses inheritance of interface (IoI), so it's abstract graph looks a little strange. Each type is considered separately and the tier axis on the left is relative. So that, from right to left, an amplifier of tier m subscribes to a sample of tier n, where m&gt;n. A harmonic can exist on any tier and subscribes to nothing. A mixer subscribes to an array of in this case 4 samples. A sample as our base type does nothing at all.

</p>
<h3>The inheritance diagram</h3>
<p>
<img src="inheritance.png" alt="inheritance"/>
</p>
<p>
A generated inheritance diagram has been added which should clarify the situation.
</p>
<p>
Amplifier, harmonic and mixer all inherit their interface (i.e. pub section) from sample. This means, looking at the abstract diagram, an amplifier could subscribe to a harmonic, <i>or</i> a mixer, or indeed another amplifier, as all three present the same pub interface. Likewise a mixer could subscribe to an array of harmonics, mixers or amplifiers for the same reason.
</p>
<h3>The concrete diagram</h3>
<p>
<img src="concrete.png" alt="concrete"/>
</p>
<p>
The concrete graph should look more familiar. This shows a graph where NUM_HARMONICS=8 and NUM_HARMONICS_PER_MIXER=2.
<p>
From this you can see that in practice, mixers subscribe to harmonics or other mixers. Only one amplifier is used and is only subscribes to a mixer.
</p>

<h2><a name="the_waveforms">The Waveforms</a></h2>
<p>
The naming convention for the files below is as follows: name+frequency+num_harmonics. So "square_f1_h1024.wav" is a square wave with frequency 1Hz, synthesised using 1024 harmonics. Likewise "hammond_f261_h16.wav" is the Hammond preset with frequency 262Hz (middle C), synthesised using 16 harmonics. These files are best viewed using a sound editor such as <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a>. Be aware that only the Hammond wave is at an audible frequency.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<h3>The sine waveform</h3>
<p>
The sine wave is the simplest waveform, comprising simply of a single sine wave of the base frequency. As such, there is no difference between the 16- and 1024-harmonic versions, so only the 16-harmonic is shown here.
</p>
<a href="sine_f1_h16.wav">sine_f1_h16.wav</a>
<blockquote><pre>
    if ( id == 1 )
        level = 1.0;
    else
	level = 0.0;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>

</p>
<h3>The pulse waveform</h3>
<p>
The pulse waveform comprises of an equal amount of each harmonic.
</p>
<a href="pulse_f1_h16.wav">pulse_f1_h16.wav</a>
<a href="pulse_f1_h1024.wav">pulse_f1_h1024.wav</a>
<blockquote><pre>
    level = 1.0;
</pre></blockquote>
<h3>The sawtooth waveform</h3>
<p>
The sawtooth waveform has a geometric drop-off of the amplitude of the component harmonics.

</p>
<a href="sawtooth_f1_h16.wav">sawtooth_f1_h16.wav</a>
<a href="sawtooth_f1_h1024.wav">sawtooth_f1_h1024.wav</a>
<blockquote><pre>
    level = 1.0 / id;
</pre></blockquote>
<h3>The square waveform</h3>
<p>
The square waveform has a geometric drop-off of the amplitude of the odd component harmonics.
</p>
<a href="square_f1_h16.wav">square_f1_h16.wav</a>
<a href="square_f1_h1024.wav">square_f1_h1024.wav</a>
<blockquote><pre>
    if ( id % 2 != 0 )		// Is odd id
	level = 1.0 / id;
    else			// Is even id
	level = 0.0;
</pre></blockquote>
<h3>The triangle waveform</h3>
<p>
The square waveform has an exponential drop-off of the amplitude, where every second active harmonic amplitude is negative.
</p>
<a href="triangle_f1_h16.wav">triangle_f1_h16.wav</a>
<a href="triangle_f1_h1024.wav">triangle_f1_h1024.wav</a>
<blockquote><pre>
    if ( id % 2 != 0 )		// Is odd id
	level = pow( -1.0, ( id - 1 ) / 2 ) * ( 1.0 / (id*id) );
    else			// Is even id
	level = 0.0;
</pre></blockquote>
<h3>The Hammond preset</h3>
<p>
This is a basic model of a Hammond tonewheel generator. More detailed information may be found <a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov03/articles/synthsecrets.htm">here</a>

<h2><a name="usage">Usage</a></h2>
<h3>Running</h3>
<p>
To run the application:<br/>
1) Download and unpack the distribution<br/>
2) cd into trad4_v3_1_2/additive_synth:<br/>
</p>
<blockquote><pre>$ cd trad4_v3_1_1/additive_synth</pre></blockquote>
3) Source additive_synth.conf:<br/>
<blockquote><pre>additive_synth$ . ./additive_synth.conf</pre></blockquote>
4) Start additive_synth:<br/>
<blockquote><pre>additive_synth$ additive_synth</pre></blockquote>
<p>
To increase or decrease the number of threads used (the default is 4), set NUM_THREADS and re-start the application:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>$ export NUM_THREADS=64
$ additive_synth</pre></blockquote>
<h3>Reconfiguring</h3>
<p>
The default configuration of the distribution is with NUM_HARMONICS_PER_MIXER=4 and NUM_HARMONICS=16. If you want to increase the number of harmonics, you do so as follows: 
</p>
<h4>1) Edit src/constants.t4s</h4>
<p>
First, edit src/constants.t4s as appropriate and save. The two values must be set do that NUM_HARMONICS is equal to NUM_HARMONICS_PER_MIXER raised to an integer power, where that integer power specifies the number of tiers of mixers you'll have, so that:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
If NUM_HARMONICS_PER_MIXER=4
pow=2 gives NUM_HARMONICS=16 so that
T3: 1 mixer
T2: 4 mixers
T1: 16 harmonics
pow=3 gives NUM_HARMONICS=64 so that
T4: 1 mixer
T3: 4 mixers
T2: 16 mixers
T1: 64 harmonics

If NUM_HARMONICS_PER_MIXER=8
pow=2 gives NUM_HARMONICS=64 so that
T3: 1 mixer
T2: 8 mixers
T1: 64 harmonics
pow=3 gives NUM_HARMONICS=512 so that
T4: 1 mixer
T3: 8 mixers
T2: 64 mixers
T1: 512 harmonics
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
There's a performance trade-off with NUM_HARMONICS_PER_MIXER where the fewer mixers you have to sum you'll get more concurrency, but more objects to run. The optimal setting will depend on your hardware and the size of the samples you are using. This discussion is beyond the scope of this document but would make in interesting study. 
</p>
<h4>2) Run the precompiler and compile</h4>
<p>
Next, run the precompiler and compile as normal. There's some flakiness in the makefiles when adjusting just the constants so you should do a clean build (-a for t4p):
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
additive_synth$ t4p -a
additive_synth$ make clean
additive_synth$ make
</pre></blockquote>
<h4>3) Regenerate and reload the database</h4>
<p>
The generated data is keyed off the constants, so it will need regenerating and and the database will need recreating and reloading. The default location of the generated data is data/worked_example. This is done as follows:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
additive_synth/data$ generate_data.pl
additive_synth/data$ recreate_db.sh
additive_synth/data$ reload_db.sh worked_example
</pre></blockquote>
<h4>4) Run as usual</h4>
<blockquote><pre>
additive_synth$ additive_synth
</pre></blockquote>
<h3>Changing the frequency</h3>
<p>
To change the base frequency you need to set BASE_FREQUENCY in src/constants.t4s as appropriate, then precompile, recompile and run, again using a clean build: 
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
additive_synth$ t4p -a
additive_synth$ make clean
additive_synth$ make
additive_synth$ additive_synth
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> If you try and model very high frequencies using the 44100Hz sample rate and many harmonics you may run up against the Nyquist frequency cutoff. The Nyquist frequency is the highest frequency a particular sample rate can support. If this happens, you will see a warning that these higher frequencies are being ignored.

</p>



<h3>Adding a new waveform</h3>
<p>
The initial harmonics are set up on startup where the calculate function calls get_level. To add a new waveform you'll need to extend this function as appropriate. This is done by:
</p>
<h4>1) Add the new enum</h4>
<p>
The new enum needs to be added to waveform_enum in src/enum.t4s. Edit this file and save.
</p>
<h4>2) Extend the get_level function</h4>
<p>
Edit objects/harmonic.c and extend the get_level function as appropriate.
</p>
<h4>3) Update your existing database to use the new waveform</h4>
<blockquote><pre>
additive_synth$ t4db
SQL> update harmonic set waveform=&lt;new_waveform_id&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<h4>4) Compile and run as usual</h4>
<blockquote><pre>
additive_synth$ make
additive_synth$ additive_synth
</pre></blockquote>
